Analyze the following document and respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format:

{
    "scores": {
        "clarity": 85,
        "tone": 90,
        "alignment": 75,
        "efficiency": 80,
        "completeness": 95
    },
    "snippetFeedback": [
        {
            "snippet": "paste the exact text you're commenting on here",
            "comment": "your specific feedback about this text"
        }
    ],
    "generalComments": [
        "Your first general comment about the document",
        "Your second general comment if needed"
    ]
}

Important rules:
1. Your entire response must be valid JSON - do not include any text before or after the JSON
2. All scores must be numbers between 0 and 100
3. snippetFeedback must contain exact quotes from the document
4. Do not use line breaks within comment strings
5. Escape any quotes within strings
6. Keep snippet selections focused and specific
7. Provide 2-4 general comments
8. Include 2-5 snippet feedback items

Remember: Respond ONLY with the JSON object - no other text.
